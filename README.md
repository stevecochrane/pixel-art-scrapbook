Pixel Art Scrapbook
===================

A prototype of a web application for cataloguing pixel art that inspires you, for reference when you make your own. It uses [Ember](http://emberjs.com) for MVC, [Node](http://nodejs.org) + [Express](http://expressjs.com) for a simple RESTful API and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) for the database. There are two versions here: "front-end-only" is just a demo of the interface with the back-end functionality removed, [as seen on my portfolio site](http://stevecochrane.com/portfolio/pixel-art-scrapbook/). You can make changes but nothing is stored. "full-functionality" is the full version but you'll need to run a local Node server to use it.

I learned most of what I needed to make this from the [Building an Ember.js Application](http://youtu.be/1QHrlFlaXdI) screencast and from [Creating a REST API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB](http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/) by Christophe Coenraets.
