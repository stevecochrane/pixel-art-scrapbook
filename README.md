Pixel Art Scrapbook
===================

A prototype of an application for cataloguing pixel art that inspires you, for reference when you make your own. It uses [Ember](http://emberjs.com) for MVC, [Node](http://nodejs.org) + [Express](http://expressjs.com) for a simple RESTful API and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) for the database. There are ~~two~~ three versions here: "front-end-only" is just a demo of the interface with the back-end functionality removed, [as seen on my portfolio site](http://stevecochrane.com/portfolio/pixel-art-scrapbook/). You can make changes but nothing is stored. "full-functionality" is the full version but you'll need to run a local Node server to use it. The most recent version, "desktop", is a desktop application built with [TideSDK](http://www.tidesdk.org). For now it's the same as the web versions but this is the one I'm going to build on. To give it a try, get the TideSDK Developer app, hit the Import Project button, and select the `desktop/build` directory to open the project. Note that this application is pre-release software with local file access, so use at your own risk.

I learned most of what I needed to make this from the [Building an Ember.js Application](http://youtu.be/1QHrlFlaXdI) screencast and from [Creating a REST API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB](http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/) by Christophe Coenraets.

This app has been a sort of playground for new technologies that I've wanted to try out, so I'm also using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) here which is fantastic. In both versions of the app, I use 'grunt watch' to watch for changes to the Sass files and then immediately compile to uncompressed CSS, and the default 'grunt' is a build script that will minify the HTML and images, compile the compressed CSS, lint first-party JavaScript with [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com), concatenate all JavaScript into a single file, and then minify that file with [UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
